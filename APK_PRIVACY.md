## How to Download (When Ready)

1. **Login Required**: Must be logged in as `camelt0e`
2. **Direct Link**: https://expo.dev/accounts/camelt0e/projects/claw-app/builds
3. **No public URL**: The download link requires authentication

---

## Distribution Settings

Your build uses:
```json
{
  "profile": "preview",
  "distribution": "internal"
}
```

This means:
- ✅ Private build
- ✅ Internal use only
- ✅ Not published to Play Store
- ✅ Not publicly listed

## What If You Want to Share Later?

If you want someone else to install it:
1. Download the APK yourself
2. Send the file directly (email, Dropbox, etc.)
3. OR add them as a collaborator in Expo

The build itself stays private to your account.

## Build Artifacts Retention

Expo keeps builds for ~30 days, then auto-deletes.
Download your APK as soon as it's ready!
