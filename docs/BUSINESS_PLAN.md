# CLAW Business Plan
## The Intention Economy

---

## Executive Summary

CLAW is a context-aware intention archive that captures micro-intentions and resurfaces them at the right moment. We're building the infrastructure for the "Intention Economy"—a $50B+ market opportunity.

**The Ask:** $2M Seed Round
**Use of Funds:** Team (40%), Product (35%), Growth (25%)
**Target:** 100K users in Year 1, $1M ARR by Year 2

---

## The Problem: Contextual Amnesia

### By The Numbers
- **47** - Average micro-intentions per person per day
- **<5%** - Actually acted upon
- **$1,200/year** - Average value of forgotten intentions (restaurants, products, ideas)

### Why Current Solutions Fail
| Solution | Capture Friction | Resurfacing | Expiration |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| Notes Apps | Medium | Manual | Never |
| Bookmarks | Low | Never | Never |
| Todo Apps | High | Scheduled | Manual |
| Reminders | Medium | Time-only | Manual |
| **CLAW** | **3 sec** | **Context-aware** | **Auto (7 days)** |

---

## The Solution: Context-Aware Resurfacing

### Core Innovation
CLAW doesn't just store intentions—it **understands context** and surfaces them when:
- You're near a relevant location
- You open a specific app (Amazon, Netflix)
- Time context matches (evening, weekend)
- Activity context aligns (driving, shopping)

### The Hook
> "I got a notification for a book while browsing Amazon. I bought it instantly. I've been trying to remember that book for 3 weeks."

### Key Differentiators
1. **AI-Native:** LLM-powered categorization & context extraction
2. **Frictionless:** Voice-first, 3-second capture
3. **Smart Expiration:** 7-day default prevents hoarding
4. **Social:** "Claw Forward" viral mechanic

## Technology Moat

### Data Flywheel
```
More Users → More Claws → Better AI → Better Resurfacing 
     ↑                                              ↓
   Retention ←─── Satisfaction ←────── Higher Strike Rate
```

### Network Effects
- **Direct:** More friends = more "claw forwards"
- **Indirect:** More users = better location/app detection
- **Data:** More behavior = smarter predictions

### Defensibility
1. **Proprietary Context Graph:** User × Location × Time × Intent
2. **Resurfacing Algorithm:** 6 months of training data
3. **Brand:** "CLAW it" becomes verb (like "Google it")
